### Git Repository Challenge

This challenge is intended as a review of Git and introduce the basics of the command line.

#### Components

This challenge is comprised of five basic components.

1.  The `index.html` file will contain the content of my page.
  * I included the `meta` tag and inserted the `charset` as recommend by the Mozilla Dev Network.
  * I included the `type` attribute even though it's rarely needed.
2.  The `stylesheet.css` file will style that content.
3.  The `app.js` file will add some functionality and interactivity to my page.
  * The included function doesn't really do anything at the moment.
4.  The `README.md` file will describe the nature of this project.
5.  The `Git` repositories serve as decentralized storage and tracking of the files that make up my project.
